# Brain-tumor-classification
(Project in the class of EGBE602_Advanced Signal Processing and Intrumentation)


The purpose of this study is to present a CNN model for brain tumor classification of three tumor types (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor) and no tumor from T1W-MRI.

Comparison of model efficiency between traditional CNN and different transfer learning architectures (ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0).
